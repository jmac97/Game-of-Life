# Conway's Game of Life using Qt and C++

## Work in progress! Please see milestones/issues to see what I've been up to

TL;DR status:
  * You can click around on cells to make them alive/dead, but only before you press play
  * Play/pause button
  * Reset button
  * Little slider to change the speed
